# **Malware Attribution via Clustering and Intelligence Feeds (MACIF)**

## **Introduction**
This project began with a fundamental question:
**What are the critical research areas in malware, threat actors, and threat intelligence, and how can AI enhance them?**

Driven by this inquiry, I explored how AI could assist in three key areas:
1. **Classifying malware** based on shared characteristics.
2. **Attributing malware** to specific threat actors or campaigns.
3. **Integrating threat intelligence** to enrich analysis and improve detection.

The goal of this study is to develop a set of workflows that leverage AI, feature extraction, and clustering techniques to analyze malware and generate actionable insights. While the project is ongoing, the foundational workflow, malware_clustering_analysis, has been successfully implemented. This workflow demonstrates how AI can be applied to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and enhance our understanding of malware behavior and evolution.

Future workflows will expand upon this foundation, focusing on dynamic analysis, threat actor attribution, and emerging threat detection, as outlined in the project's roadmap. Together, these workflows aim to provide a comprehensive platform for malware research and threat intelligence.

## **Project Goals**
1. **Malware Clustering**: Group malware samples into distinct clusters based on shared characteristics (e.g., file size, entropy, YARA matches).
2. **Threat Attribution**: Identify relationships between clusters and attribute them to potential threat actors using shared traits and techniques.
3. **Emerging Threat Detection**: Detect anomalies and new malware samples that deviate from known clusters.
4. **Research Facilitation**: Provide a platform for exploring malware behavior, toolkits, and threat actor ecosystems.
5. **Visualization and Insights**: Generate clear visual representations of clustering results for actionable insights.

## **Potential Workflows**
This project is designed to be extensible, with the potential to integrate multiple workflows. Below is a checklist of planned and completed workflows:

- [x] **Malware Clustering Analysis**: A workflow for clustering malware samples based on extracted static features.
- [ ] **Dynamic Feature Analysis**: Extract and cluster malware based on runtime behaviors (e.g., API calls, network activity).
- [ ] **Threat Actor Attribution**: Map clusters to threat actors using threat intelligence feeds and YARA rules.
- [ ] **Emerging Threat Detection**: Identify anomalies and new malware campaigns through advanced clustering techniques.
- [ ] **Threat Landscape Analysis**: Explore relationships between malware families and shared actor toolkits.

## **Features**
- **Static Feature Extraction**: Analyze malware properties like file size, PE headers, and section entropy.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Supports KMeans and HDBSCAN for flexible grouping of malware samples.
- **YARA Rule Integration**: Matches samples to predefined rules, aiding in attribution and classification.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags outliers within clusters for further analysis.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate PCA-based visualizations for better cluster interpretation.

## **Potential Insights and Research Opportunities**
### **Cluster-Level Insights**
- **Cluster Composition**: Understand the types of malware grouped within each cluster (e.g., ransomware, info-stealers).
- **Feature Dominance**: Determine which features (e.g., file size, PE headers) define each cluster.
- **Cluster Overlaps**: Explore similarities between clusters to uncover shared traits or techniques.
- **Cluster Outliers**: Detect anomalies within clusters that differ significantly from the norm.

### **Threat Actor Attribution**
- **Actor Diversity Across Clusters**: Analyze tools or techniques shared across clusters, potentially revealing collaboration.
- **Actor-Specific Clusters**: Identify clusters dominated by a single actorâ€™s malware.
- **Cluster Dominance**: Associate clusters with specific malware families used by certain threat actors.

### **Emerging Threat and Anomaly Detection**
- **Unknown Samples**: Detect clusters with no strong ties to known actors or families.
- **Emerging Campaigns**: Identify patterns suggesting new campaigns or evolving techniques.

### **Behavioral and Temporal Insights**
- **Behavioral Evolution**: Track how malware tactics and techniques evolve over time.
- **Threat Actor Toolkits**: Visualize the range of malware types or tools used by specific actors.
