# **Malware Attribution via Clustering and Intelligence Feeds (MACIF)**

## **Introduction**
This project began with a fundamental question:
**What are the critical research areas in malware, threat actors, and threat intelligence, and how can AI enhance them?**

Driven by this inquiry, I explored how AI could assist in three key areas:
1. **Classifying malware** based on shared characteristics.
2. **Attributing malware** to specific threat actors or campaigns.
3. **Integrating threat intelligence** to enrich analysis and improve detection.

The goal of this study is to develop a set of workflows that leverage AI, feature extraction, and clustering techniques to analyze malware and generate actionable insights. While the project is ongoing, the foundational workflow, `malware_clustering_analysis`, has been successfully implemented. This workflow demonstrates how AI can be applied to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and enhance our understanding of malware behavior and evolution.

Future workflows will expand upon this foundation, focusing on **dynamic analysis**, **threat actor attribution**, and **emerging threat detection**, as outlined in the project's roadmap. Together, these workflows aim to provide a comprehensive platform for malware research and threat intelligence.

## **Project Goals**
1. **Malware Clustering**: Group malware samples into distinct clusters based on shared characteristics (e.g., file size, entropy, YARA matches).
2. **Threat Attribution**: Identify relationships between clusters and attribute them to potential threat actors using shared traits and techniques.
3. **Emerging Threat Detection**: Detect anomalies and new malware samples that deviate from known clusters.
4. **Research Facilitation**: Provide a platform for exploring malware behavior, toolkits, and threat actor ecosystems.
5. **Visualization and Insights**: Generate clear visual representations of clustering results for actionable insights.
